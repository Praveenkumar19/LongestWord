# Longest Word in the Dictionary using Python
Overview
The Longest Word Finder is a Python class designed to find the longest word in a list of words that can be built from its prefixes. The class utilizes efficient data structures and sorting methods to quickly identify the valid longest word.

This Python program defines a solution to find the longest word in a given list of words, where each prefix of the word must also be present in the list.

## Features

- Efficiently finds the longest word that can be built from its prefixes.
- Utilizes a set for quick lookup of words.
- Sorts the words first by length and then lexicographically.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the provided code into a Python file (e.g., `longest_word_finder.py`).
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python longest_word_finder.py
The output will display the longest valid word found in the provided list.
Code Explanation
Class Definition: The Solution class contains the method longestWord.

Method longestWord:

Accepts a list of words as input.
Converts the list to a set for O(1) average-time complexity lookups.
Sorts the words by length (in descending order) and lexicographically.
Iterates through the sorted list and checks if all prefixes of each word are in the set. The first valid word found is returned as the longest word.
Example Usage: The if __name__ == "__main__": block provides an example list of words and prints the longest valid word.

Customization
You can customize the list of words in the words variable to test with different datasets.
